# README Files

Do not include code in README files.
This requires more effort to keep the README's up to date.
Please instead provide a link to any code that should be referenced.

# Code Structure

Please prefer moving types that have their own methods/behaviors to their own files.
The preference is towards a larger number of smaller files that fully encapsulate one concept.

# Go Code

Please make sure each go file that is created or edited if formated with `go fmt`.
