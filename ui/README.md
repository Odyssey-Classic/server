Odyssey Admin UI (scaffold)

This is a minimal Vite + React + PixiJS scaffold for the Admin UI maps editor MVP.

Quick start

1. cd ui
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes

- The app is desktop-first and implements a simple Pixi-powered `MapCanvas` component and a tile palette.
- The scaffold uses TypeScript and SCSS. It intentionally keeps the logic light and uses a mock store for map data.
- Integrate with the server by replacing the mock adapters with calls to the server's admin maps service.
